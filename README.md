# Rock Paper Scissors

This project is a part of 'The Odin Project`. The project focuses mainly on mainly using JavaScript to build a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. 

To focus on the fundamental concepts, the game is first built to play on the console. This game is a 5 round game.

However, at a later stage of the course, I have added the User Interface to make the game interactive.

The features of the game are as follows:

1. A computer picks it's choice randomly.
2. User clicks on one of the buttons - ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS
3. The display, shows the winner of the round, and the user and computer scores are updated.
4. Once, user or the computer wins 5 rounds the winner is declared and the game is reset.

## Skills:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. DOM Manipulation
