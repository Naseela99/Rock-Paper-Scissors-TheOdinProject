# Rock Paper Scissors

This project is a part of 'The Odin Project`. The project focuses mainly on mainly using JavaScript to build a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. To focus on the fundamental concepts, the game is first built to play on the console. This game is a 5 round game.

At a later stage, GUI will be added to make the game interactive.
